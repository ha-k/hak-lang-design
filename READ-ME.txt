Directory Organization:

This directory is split into four logical units that comprise the
hlt.language.design.* packages:

   Package hlt.language.design.kernel

	contains the classes defining the kernel language expressions
	and their sanitizer and compiler;

   Package hlt.language.design.types

	contains the classes defining the types and the typechecker,
	and the symbol table entries

   Package hlt.language.design.instructions

	contains the classes defining the abstract machine intructions
	based on an abstract interface for a runtime system;

   Package hlt.language.design.backend

	contains the classes defining the runtime system.

Some kernel classes import the types and instructions packages, and so do some of the backend's runtime; some classes in instructions import types; the classes in types involved in type-checking import the kernel package.

The inter-package import diagram is:

	  --------------<---------------
	 /                              \
      kernel --<--->-- types --<-->--instructions -->-- backend
                          \                               /
	                   ------------->-----------------

where an arrow -->-- means "import".
